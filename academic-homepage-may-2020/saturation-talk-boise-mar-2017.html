    <h1>Saturation and solvability in abstract elementary classes with amalgamation</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the 2017 North American meeting of the ASL at Boise State University on March 21, 2017. The talk presents the corresponding <a href="papers/vasey-ap-universal/vasey-categ-saturated_latest.pdf">paper</a>. Here are the <a href="talk-asl-mar-2017.pdf">slides</a>.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Abstract elementary classes (AECs) are an axiomatic framework encompassing classes of models of an <em>L<sub>∞, ω</sub></em> theory, as well as numerous algebraic examples. They were introduced by Saharon Shelah forty years ago. Shelah focused on generalizations of Morley's categoricity theorem and conjectured the following eventual version: An AEC categorical in a high-enough cardinal is categorical on a tail of cardinals.
      </p>
    <p>
In a <a href="http://shelah.logic.at/files/394.pdf">milestone paper</a>, Shelah proved a downward version of the conjecture for AECs with amalgamation when the categoricity cardinal is a successor. In this talk, we will deal with AECs with amalgamation categorical in a not necessarily successor cardinal. We will discuss the generalization of the first step of the proof of Morley's categoricity theorem to that setup:
    </p>
    <p><em>Theorem.</em> Let <em>K</em>$ be an AEC with amalgamation and let λ &gt; <em>LS(K)</em>. If <em>K</em> is categorical in λ, then the model of cardinality λ is saturated (for orbital types).
    </p>

    <p>
The proof uses several results from the superstability theory of AECs, including criterias for the uniqueness of limit models. Time permitting, we will also talk about solvability, a weak form of categoricity introduced by Shelah in his book on AECs as a generalization of superstability. An application of the proof of the above theorem is a downward transfer of solvability:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Theorem.</em> Let <em>K</em> be an AEC with amalgamation and let λ &gt; μ &gt; <em>LS(K)</em>. If <em>K</em> is solvable in λ, then <em>K</em> is solvable in μ.
    </p>
