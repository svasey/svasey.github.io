    <h1>Synthesis for Rational Linear Arithmetic</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of my undergraduate thesis, written at <a href="http://epfl.ch/">EPFL</a> in June 2011. I would like to thank Prof. <a href="http://lara.epfl.ch/~kuncak/">Viktor Kuncak</a> for supervising me on this project.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I describe rchoosec, a tool to synthesize code snippets from
      speciﬁcations written in the language of linear rational
      arithmetic. rchoosec produces
      a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> subroutine that
      can readily be integrated in a more complex project. The main
      idea is to let the programmer describe what is wanted rather
      than how to obtain it. Another goal is to produce code that is
      specialized to the task at hand, so that it runs faster than
      calling a generic solver. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I outline some possible practical applications in control
      theory. In particular, I present a “proof of concept” simulator
      of a rocket in a gravitational ﬁeld. The rocket’s engine is
      partially controlled by synthesized code.
