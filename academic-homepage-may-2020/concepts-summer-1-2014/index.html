    <h2>Lecture notes</h2>
    <p>
      I am writing my own lecture notes for the course. They are no substitute for attending lectures, but you are advised to read them as the course goes on. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download them from here: <a href="vasey-concepts-notes_latest.pdf">Lecture notes</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are a work in progress and will be updated many times throughout the semester. If you see a mistake or a typo, please let me know (you may even get some extra credit).
