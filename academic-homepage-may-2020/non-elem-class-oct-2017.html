    <h1>Non-elementary classification theory</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the <a href="http://math.harvard.edu/~wboney/seminar/">Harvard Logic Seminar</a> on October 31, 2017.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The classification theory of elementary classes was started by Michael Morley in the early sixties, when he proved that a countable first-order theory with a single model in some uncountable cardinal has a single model in all uncountable cardinals. The proof of this result, now called Morley's categoricity theorem, led to the development of forking, a joint generalization of linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence of fields, which is now a central pillar of modern model theory. 
    </p>
    <p>
In recent years, it has become apparent that the theory of forking can also be developed in several non-elementary contexts. Prime among those is the axiomatic framework of abstract elementary classes (AECs), encompassing the class of models of any <em>L<sub>∞, ω</sub></em>-theory and closely connected to the more general framework accessible categories. A test question to judge progress in this direction is the forty year old eventual categoricity conjecture of Shelah, which says that a version of Morley's categoricity theorem should hold of any AEC. I will survey recent developments, including the connections with category theory and large cardinals as well as my resolution of the eventual categoricity conjecture for classes of models axiomatized by a <em>universal</em> <em>L<sub>∞, ω</sub></em>-theory.
