    <h1>Independence in tame abstract elementary classes</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the model theory seminar at the City University of New York on Oct. 31, 2014. The talk presents <a href="papers/superstability/vasey-superstability-aec_latest.pdf">the corresponding paper</a>. Here are <a href="presentation-south-korea-2014.pdf">slides from a similar talk in South Korea</a>.

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
Good frames are one of the main notions in Shelah's classification theory for abstract elementary classes. Roughly speaking, a good frame describes a local forking-like notion for the class. In Shelah's book, the theory of good frames is developped over hundreds of pages, and many results rely on GCH-like hypotheses and sophisticated combinatorial set theory.
    </p>
    <p>
In this talk, I will argue that dealing with good frames is much easier if one makes the global assumption of tameness (a locality condition introduced by Grossberg and VanDieren). I will outline a proof of the following result: Assume K is a tame abstract elementary class which has amalgamation, no maximal models, and is categorical in a cardinal of cofinality greater than the tameness cardinal. Then K is stable everywhere and has a good frame.
