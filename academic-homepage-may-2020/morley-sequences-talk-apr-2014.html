    <h1>Indiscernible extraction and Morley sequences</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the 15th Annual Graduate Student Conference in Logic (University of Wisconsin - Madison) on Apr. 27, 2014. The talk presents <a href="papers/morley-seq/vasey-morley-seq_latest.pdf">the corresponding paper</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      It is well known that inside a model of a stable first-order
      theory, any long-enough sequence contains indiscernibles. This
      fails if the theory is unstable, but Shelah observed that one
      can still, in a technical sense, extract indiscernibles on the
      side of the original sequence. It turns out such indiscernible
      extraction theorems can be used to build Morley sequences, one
      of the basic tools of first-order classification theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the unstable case, the lengths involved are quite big: Shelah
      asked for the original sequence to have size ב‎<sub>γ</sub>,
      where γ = (2<sup>|T|</sup>)<sup>+</sup>, and |T| is the number
      of formulas in the underlying language. Grossberg, Iovino and
      Lessmann later improved this to ב‎<sub>δ</sub>, for δ &lt; γ, and asked whether, at least in simple unstable
      theories, Morley sequences could be built without using such big
      cardinals.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Using a 47 year old idea of Gaifman, I will answer this question by
	  showing (in simple theories) how to construct a Morley sequence from
	  any infinite independent sequence. I aim to make the talk reasonably
	  self-contained and use only minimal background.
    </p>
