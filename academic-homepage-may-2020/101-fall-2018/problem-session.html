    <p>
      Problem sessions are times when you can have more practice with the concepts seen in class. They are completely optional, but you are encouraged to attend: this will give you an opportunity to check your understanding and clarify any unclear concepts. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem sessions are held on Fridays at 10h30AM or 3PM alternatively, in SC 229. See the announcements on the main page for more.

    <h4>Problem session of September 21, 2018 (Michele Tienni)</h4>
    <p>
      We covered mainly problem 17 in Chapter 10 of Hammack, and along the way we discussed some related topics. Some of the main points were:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  I went over the definition of set complement, especially why we always need a universal set to define it.
	</li>
	<li>I explained ways in which we can prove an equality of sets by proving both inclusions at once by using "if and only if" statements.
	</li>
	<li>In the last ten minutes we did a quick induction problem involving a summation (problem 3 in Chapter 10 of Hammack) and went over sigma notation.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
