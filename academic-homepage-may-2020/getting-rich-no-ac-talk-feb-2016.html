    <h1>How to get rich without the axiom of choice</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the CMU Graduate Student Seminar on February 23, 2016. A video of the talk is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYTkZpyLw0o">Youtube</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The Banach-Tarski paradox says that one can decompose a unit ball into finitely many pieces, and move and rotate these pieces to obtain two disjoint unit balls. One can use this as a "get rich quick" scheme: buy one unit ball of gold, duplicate it using Banach-Tarski, sell it back, and repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
One may consider the paradox (or our failure to get rich by using it) as evidence that the axiom of choice is false. In this talk, I will assume that choice fails and discuss another paradox: the existence of an equivalence relation with more classes than points. This leads to another "get rich quick" scheme: get (or borrow) as much money as there are real numbers, put your money in boxes in a smart way, then sell each box for a dollar. The argument I will give is based on slides by Michael Ray Oliver titled "How to have more things by forgetting where you put them".
