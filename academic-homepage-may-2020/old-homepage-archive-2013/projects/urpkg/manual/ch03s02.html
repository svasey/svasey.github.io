  There is an importance distinction to make between a package name and a
  package user. As already mentioned, urpkg creates a new user for each program
  (urpkg calls them package) you install. The files that are then created all
  have the new user as owner and can therefore easily be found.
</p><div class="sect2" title="Generating a username"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id422913"></a>Generating a username</h3></div></div></div><p>
    However, urpkg first has to come up with a name for this user. The name should
    conform to the syntax of a username (e.g, no dot in the name) and should not
    be the same as other users in the system. One could simply come up with a
    unique number as username, however that would be really confusing and not
    really helpful e.g to someone listing a file belonging to that package. 
  </p><p>
    The solution that urpkg uses is the following. We ask the user for, or
    guess, a <span class="emphasis"><em>package name</em></span> that is basically the name of the
    program we are installing. This name can syntactically be anything the user
    wants. Then, from that name we generate a <span class="emphasis"><em>package user
      name</em></span>. The package name is kept in the comment field of the user
    name in <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code>.
  </p><p>
    The package user name always begins
    with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">urpkg-</span>”</span>. This is a prefix to avoid that the
    name collides with another user of the system. Urpkg then
    generates the rest of the username using the beginning of the
    package name, and adding some numbers if necessary. You should
    look at the source if you want more details on the exact algorithm
    which is used. Special characters in the package name are replaced
    by <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">_</span>”</span>. For example, from a package
    name <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">emacs-22</span>”</span>, the package user could
    be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">urpkg-emacs-22</span>”</span>. You shouldn't rely on
    this, however, as the algorithm used by urpkg to generate user
    names can change at any release without notice !
  </p><p>
    Note that package names (and package users) are always all in lowercase
    letters. Even if you give your name explicitly, the case does not matter
    and your name will automatically be converted to lowercase. For example,
    running
  </p><pre class="screen">
    <code class="prompt">$ </code>urpkg --install --pkg-name=Emacs-22 make install
  </pre><p>
    Will still create a package name <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">emacs-22</span>”</span> and a package
    user <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">urpkg-emacs-22</span>”</span>.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding the package user owning a file"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id423022"></a>Finding the package user owning a file</h3></div></div></div><p>
    In general, you don't have to worry about package users, but it's good to
    know about them, as you can still see them mentioned from time to time. For
    example, assuming you really have emacs installed as a package named
    emacs-22, doing 
  </p><pre class="screen">
    <code class="prompt">$ </code>ls -l $(which emacs)
    -rwxr-xr-t 2 urpkg-emacs-22 urpkg-emacs-22 13576490 2008-03-21 17:59 /usr/bin/emacs
  </pre><p>
    will really give you the package user name of the package the
    file <code class="filename">/usr/bin/emacs</code> belongs to.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Finding a package name"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id423054"></a>Finding a package name</h3></div></div></div><p>
    As you learned in the previous chapter, you can specify a package name
    explicitly using <code class="option">--pkg-name</code>. Urpkg can also guess a
    package name for you from the current directory. Now how does it do it ?
  </p><p>
    Urpkg will simply take the basename of your current directory (i.e if your
    current directory is <code class="filename">/var/tmp/emacs-22.1</code>, the basename
    is <code class="filename">emacs-22.1</code>). It will then check if it has a version
    string. A version string is defined as anything following a dash
    (<code class="code">-</code>). In our example, there is a version string so the package
    name would be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">emacs-22.1</span>”</span>. If there is no version string,
    urpkg will append one with the date in the following
    format: <code class="code">YYYYmmdd</code>. For example, if you are developing your own
    program, foo which is in a directory <code class="filename">/var/tmp/foo</code>, then
    if you install it on June, 30th 2010 the package name will
    be <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">foo-20100630</span>”</span>.
  </p><p>
    Of course, there cannot be two package with the same name
    installed on the system, so urpkg will signal an error if you try
    to give a package name which is already the name of an existing package.
