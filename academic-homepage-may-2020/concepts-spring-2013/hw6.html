    <h1>Feedback on hw 6</h1>
    <h2>4.10</h2>
    <p>
      This one was well-understood. Notice that you really need a to be nonzero to have f bijective. Also, once you have proven that f is bijective, it is enough to say that g must also be bijective,
      since it has exactly the same form. 
    </p>
    <h2>4.34</h2>
    <p>
      A lot of you proved part (a) by showing the contrapositive. This is perfectly okay, but is not needed: the same proof will work to give the result directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In part (b), drawing a picture is very helpful, but you should always write down your counter-examples symbolically as well (and check it works): pictures can be <a href="pi-equal-four.jpg">misleading</a>.
    </p>
    <p>	
      Also, when you define a function f from A to B, make sure that it really maps to B, e.g. f(x) = x - 1 is <emph>not</emph> a function from the naturals to the naturals (why ?).
    </p>
    <h2>4.37</h2>
    <p>
      This is actually a special case of 4.34 (a), so there was no need to prove it again.
