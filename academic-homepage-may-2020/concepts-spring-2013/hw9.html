    <h2>Problem 6.5</h2>
    <p>
      Remember that from gcd (a,b) with a &lt; b, the Euclidean algorithm goes directly to gcd (a, r), where 0 &le; r &lt; a is the remainder of the division of b by a. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that gcd (a,b) = gcd(a, b - a), and computing the gcd using this method would work, but this is not how the Euclidean algorithm operates.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 6.17</h2>
    <p>
      Most of you got this one right.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 6.28</h2>
    <p>
      An easy way to solve this was to consider the prime factorization of a and b, and use the fact they are completely disjoint, i.e. no prime appears in both of them. 
      It was also possible to give a proof from the definition of dividing and gcd. Be careful when using the definition of dividing though: a divides b if there is an integer k such that b = ka (and not the other way around: a is potentially smaller than b).
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 6.35</h2>
    <p>
      Except for some off-by-one errors (a few of you gave only n - 1 consecutive non-prime integers), most of you had the correct idea.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem 6.39</h2>
    <p>
      I went over this in recitation. Most of you correctly wrote that if n is not prime, then 2<sup>n</sup> - 1 = ab for some integers a and b. 
    </p>
    <p>
      By itself, this doesn't prove anything, since one could have e.g. a = 1 and b = 2<sup>n</sup> - 1, so you shouldn't forget to argue that <em>both</em> a and b are greater than 1.
