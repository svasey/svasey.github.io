    <h1>Recitation of Apr. 11, 2013</h1>
    <p>
      We discussed existence of multiplicative inverses in modular arithmetic, and solved problem 7.1 . A few examples of equations of the form ax &equiv; b mod n were considered, and we finally talked about the general case. We quickly looked at Problem 7.20 which gives a neat proof that k - 1 divides k<sup>n</sup> - 1.

    <p>
      In my opinion, the most important facts about modular arithmetic we have seen so far are:
      
      <ol>
	<li>For all relatively prime integers a and b, there are integers s and t such that sa + tb = 1.</li>
	<li>Multiplicative inverses do <em>not</em> always exist.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The first fact is the one from which pretty much everything else you have seen can be derived, and the second is an important warning.
