    <h1>Recitation of Feb. 7, 2013</h1>
    <p>
      We discussed the handshake problem (c.f p.50 and 60 in your textbook) as yet another example of a proof by induction. I tried to explain why p implies not q was <em>not</em> the negation of p implies q. 
      Since my explanation did not seem too satisfactory, I will try to find the ultimate explanation for next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some more problems on induction: 3.31/3.32, 3.33, 3.39,
      3.40, Proposition 3.16 and Problem 3.49. A lot of those problems require formulating a guess before proving it by induction, which should make them more challenging than those you have experienced so far.
