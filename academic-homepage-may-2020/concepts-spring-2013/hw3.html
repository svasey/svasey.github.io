    <h1>Feedback on hw 3</h1>
    <p>
      Some students wrote the inductive step of their induction &quot;backward&quot; : i.e. they started with what needed to be proven, and arrived to the induction hypothesis, or the definition, after some work. 
      This is confusing because a proof should always start from a true fact to get to the desired conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In your writeup, you should make the following explicit:
      <ul>
	<li>The statement you are proving</li>
	<li>The method of proof you are using (in that case, induction)</li>
	<li>What your induction hypothesis is, and where exactly you are using it</li>
      </ul>

      In general, if it is not completely obvious, it is always nice to write a small explanation for each step, e.g. &quot;by the triangle inequality&quot;, or &quot;by the induction hypothesis&quot;, such and such follows.
