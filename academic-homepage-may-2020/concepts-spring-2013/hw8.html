    <h1>Feedback on hw 8</h1>
    <p>
      People generally did very well on that homework !  
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common mistakes were in problem 5.19 and problem 5.31 . In 5.19, finding a simple general formula appears to be difficult, so the easiest was to just consider each value of k separately. 
      In problem 5.31, some of you overcounted: i.e. counted a single possibility several times (e.g. in this exercise, the pair (A,B) was the same as (B,A)).  
      It is easy to make such mistakes, always take a moment to check you are really counting distinct arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, remember to always write sentences in plain English explaning your formulas, this will help you (and the grader) understand what you are doing better, and avoid making mistakes.
