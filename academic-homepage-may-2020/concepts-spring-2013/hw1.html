	A common mistake was to start with the inequality to be
	proven, and then finish with a true statement such as x<sup>2</sup> &ge; 0. The way to prove something is always to start from a true statement and finish with what is to be proven. </p>

	<p>
	The only reason the other approach "seems to work", is because
	the steps taken can all be <em>reversed</em>, but this has to
	be made explicit (and justified) . 
	</p>

	<p>
	Your textbook has more explanations on that particular
	mistake, p. 43. (The section right before the problems usually contains very valuable advice...).

	Another common mistake was in the conditions for equality to hold: it is not necessary that y + z = 2. For example equality holds if x = 0, y = z = 2. The mistake is due to assuming that one needs y + z = 2 to have x(y + z) = 2x . I will let you think about why this is not true in general...

      A few students did not think about the ambiguity raised by the number of days in the month of February.

    <h2>1.51</h2>
    <p>
      To prove equality between two sets, it is <em>not</em> enough to prove one is a subset of the other. This is also (especially) true if one is just giving an explanation for the equality in plain English.
