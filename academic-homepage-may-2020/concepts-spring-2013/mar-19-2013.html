    <h1>Recitation of Mar. 19, 2013</h1>
    <p>
      We quickly went through the proof of uncountability of the reals again. I showed a practical consequence of this: some problems cannot be solved by computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We then discussed countability of the set of pairs of natural numbers (sketching an alternate proof using the uniqueness of prime decomposition), and went through exercise 4.48 in details.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the test, it will be enough to show how to build a sequence to show that a set is countable (i.e. no need to give an explicit formula, as long as it is clear how to construct the sequence). 
      In general, the question: "what is the right level of details needed in a mathematical proof ?" is a difficult one that essentially depends on who is going to read your proof :-) . 
      You should give enough details so that everybody (including you) reading your proof can be absolutely convinced of its correctness.
    </p>
    <p>	
      Personally, I believe it is possible to give too much details, to the point of hurting understanding. An extreme example is the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a> 
      published at the beginning of the 20th Century by Russel and Whitehead, which takes 379 pages to prove that 1 + 1 = 2.
