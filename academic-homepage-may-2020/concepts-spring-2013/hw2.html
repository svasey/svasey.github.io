    <h1>Feedback on hw 2</h1>
    <h2>2.4</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	  A lot of people are confused about how to negate an implication. From a truth table, one can see directly that the negation of &quot;P implies Q&quot; is &quot;P and (not Q)&quot;.
	  Also using a truth table, one sees that the negation of &quot;P implies Q&quot; is <em>not</em> &quot;P implies (not Q)&quot;, nor &quot;(not P) implies (not Q)&quot; .
      </li>
      <li>
	  Also, please make sure that whatever you write makes sense in plain English. For example, &quot; There is x in A for all b in B such that b &le; x &quot; does not mean anything. 
	  One way to write it would be &quot; There is x in A such that for all b in B b &le; x &quot;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.10</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	There was again a lot of confusion on the negation of an implication. Here is a reminder:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The <em>converse</em> of &quot;P implies Q&quot; is defined to be &quot;Q implies P&quot; . It is not equivalent to &quot;P implies Q&quot;, but it is not its negation either.</li>
	  <li>The <em>contrapositive</em> of &quot;P implies Q&quot; is defined to be &quot;not Q implies not P&quot; . It is equivalent to &quot;P implies Q&quot;, so it cannot be its negation.</li>
	  <li>As noted above, the <em>negation</em> of &quot;P implies Q&quot; turns out to be &quot;P and not Q&quot;. </li> 
	</ul>
	<p>
	  Each of the three statements above are different.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.24</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	A few students forgot to argue <em>why</em> (a) implies (b) . Whenever you make a claim, do not forget to justify it !
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2.52</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      From x &in; (A &cap; B) - (A &cap; C) &subseteq; (A &cap; (B - C)), a lot of students claimed that x &notin; C. This is true, but this must be justified: 
      the only immediately clear statement one can make is that x &notin; A &cap; C, which is in general weaker than saying x &notin; C.</li>
      <li>Some students mixed up set and logic notation: recall that even though they behave similarly, &cap; and &and; mean different thing: one is an operator on <em>sets</em>, the other is an operator on true/false <em>statements</em>.</li>
    </ul>
