    <h1>Recitation of Sep. 19, 2013</h1>
    <p>
      We looked at several related rates problems. The method to solve those is always the same: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Draw a picture</li>
      <li>Give name to all quantities. Figure out which are changing and which are constant</li>
      <li>Figure out what you want to compute, and what you know already.</li>
      <li>Express what you want in terms of what you know</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We worked through Section 3.5.45, 3.9.11, 3.9.23 (C), 3.9.31 (G, still need to finish it).
