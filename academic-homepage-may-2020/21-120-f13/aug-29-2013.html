    <h1>Recitation of Aug. 29, 2013</h1>
    <p>
      We discussed the exponential function, and its behavior as x goes to plus and minus infinity. Recall that this depends on the value of the base, namely on whether it is larger or less than one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We computed some limits: the first thing to try is usually to plug in the value x goes to inside the expression, and see if we can get more information that way. If this does not work (and usually, it won't), there are various tricks to try: we saw two of them:
      <ul>
	<li>Factoring the polynomials involved.</li>
	<li>(with the 11h30 recitation) Multiplying by the conjugate over itself.</li>
      </ul>
      
      We will see many more tricks and methods in the coming weeks ! 
    </p>
    <p>
      9h30 recitation: I didn't have time to get to the "multiplying by the conjugate" trick. I will try to dicuss it briefly Tuesday. Here is a <a href="ex-2-3-21.pdf">handout</a> discussing it.
