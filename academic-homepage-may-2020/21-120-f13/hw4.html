    <h1>Feedback on hw 4</h1>
    <p>
      Exercise 3.3.34, 3.5.28 were graded out of 3 points, and the rest out of 2 points.
    </p>
    <p>
      To compute the limit in 3.3.48, you cannot use L'HÃ´pital's rule, as it hasn't seen yet in class.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 3.3.34, remember that sin(x) = cos(x) has infinitely many solutions, since sin and cos are periodic functions.
