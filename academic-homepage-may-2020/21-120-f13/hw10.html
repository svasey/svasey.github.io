    <h1>Feedback on hw 10</h1>
    <p>
      Exercise 5.1.24 was graded out of 6 points, 3 points for each part. Exercise 5.2.30 was graded out of 3 points. The last point was given for free.

      Overall, students did pretty well (maybe the problems were just too easy !), so I do not have anything more to say about those problems.
