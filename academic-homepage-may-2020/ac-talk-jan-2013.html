    <h1>Using the Axiom of Choice to predict the Future</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk I gave at the CMU Graduate Student Seminar on Jan. 17, 2013. 
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Consider the following puzzle: infinitely many prisoners are put
      together into a room. Each is given either a white, or a black
      hat. A prisoner can see the color of all the other prisoner's
      hat, but not the color of his own hat. Each prisoner is then
      taken apart from the others, and asked the color of his own
      hat. If he answers correctly, he is freed. The prisoners are
      forbidden to communicate in any way once they are given their
      hat, but can agree on a strategy beforehand. How many prisoners
      can you guarantee to free ? In this talk, I will discuss the
      solution to this problem, and explain how to generalize it to
      obtain a strategy predicting (with high accuracy) the future
      values of a function, given only its past values. This
      counter-intuitive result will rely heavily on the axiom of
      choice (AC). Time permitting, I will also discuss what happens
      if one takes the above to be evidence that AC is wrong. For
      example, I will prove that assuming AC is false, it is possible
      there exists an equivalence relation on a set X which has
      strictly more equivalence classes than elements in X...
