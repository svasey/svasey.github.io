    <h1>Couting to Infinity and Beyond</h1>
    <p>This is the title of a talk I gave to undergraduates at the CMU Math Club on Sep. 26, 2012. </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      How high can you count ? In elementary school, we are taught
      that there are no good answer to that question. For every
      natural number n, there is a larger number, n + 1. An answer one
      often hears is "infinity". What would that mean, and would then
      "infinity + 1" be a larger number ? What about "infinity +
      infinity" ? In this talk, I will sketch the development of a
      rigorous theory of "infinitary numbers", called ordinals, that
      go beyond the natural numbers while keeping many of their
      properties. I will also try to make sense of the notion of
      "size" of an infinite set, and show that infinite sets can in a
      very precise sense have different sizes. This will lead to very
      interesting questions, such as Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis.

      <li>A good place to learn about basic set theory is the 21-329 Set Theory course at CMU, which covers transfinite induction, ordinals, cardinals, and much more.</li>
