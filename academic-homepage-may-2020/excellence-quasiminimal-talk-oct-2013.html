    <h1>Quasiminimal Structures and Excellence</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a three-parts talk I gave at the CMU Model Theory Seminar on Oct. 14, 21, 28, 2013. I would like to thank Rami Grossberg and Alexei Kolesnikov for helpful discussions when preparing this seminar.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      A recurring theme in model theory is upward transfer of a
      property, using only information about countable structures to
      derive information on all uncountable structures. For example,
      knowing that an Abstract Elementary Class has no maximal
      countable model lets us deduce it has an uncountable model. A
      generalization of this fact was proved by Shelah in a milestone
      paper, where he showed how to obtain existence of models of an
      L<sub>ω<sub>1</sub>,ω</sub> sentence at ℵ<sub>n</sub> using a property of
      systems of countable models indexed by n-dimensional cubes that he
      called n-goodness. A class where n-goodness holds for all n is
      called excellent. It turns out that excellence implies existence
      of arbitrarily large models, and much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept of excellence got renewed attention, when Boris Zilber
      used it to study Schanuel's conjecture for the complex numbers. Zilber
      studied quasiminimal classes that had to satisfy several requirements,
      including a version of excellence. Until recently, it was unclear
      whether the excellence requirement was necessary. In this series of
      talks, I will present a result of Bays, Hart, Hyttinen, Kesälä and
      Kirby that shows it is not: Excellence holds for free in quasiminimal
      classes. I aim to make the talks reasonably self-contained and use
      only minimal backgroud.
    </p>
