    <h1>Independence in abstract elementary classes</h1>

    <p>
      This is the title of a talk given at the CMU logic seminar on April 28, 2015. The talk presents <a href="papers/independence-aecs/vasey-independence-aecs_latest.pdf">the corresponding paper</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
    Forking is one of the central notion of modern model theory. Roughly speaking, it is a notion of independence generalizing both linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence in fields. In the first-order framework, it was introduced by Shelah and is one of the main device of his book. One can ask whether there is such a notion for classes that are not first-order axiomatizable, such as classes of models of a sentence in infinitary logic. We will focus on abstract elementary classes (AECs), a very general axiomatic framework introduced by Shelah in 1985. In Shelah's book on AECs, the central concept is again a local generalization of forking: good frames. 
    </p>
    <p>
We will attempt to explain why good frames are so useful by surveying recent applications to problems like existence of saturated models or stability transfer. Time permitting, we will sketch a proof of the following approximation to a conjecture of Shelah:
    </p>
    <p>
      Theorem (modulo a claim of Shelah whose proof has yet to appear): Assume there are unboundedly many strongly compact cardinals and the weak generalized continuum hypothesis holds. Then an AEC which for a high-enough cardinal λ has a single model of size λ will have a single model of size μ for every high-enough μ.
