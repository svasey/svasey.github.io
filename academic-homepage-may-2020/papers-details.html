	  In simple theories, Morley sequences can be built using only Ramsey's theorem and compactness. This shows that the basic theory of forking in simple theories can be developped using only principles from "elementary mathematics" and answers questions of Grossberg-Iovino-Lessmann and Baldwin. Using an argument of Itay Kaplan, we also obtain a new characterization of simple theories in terms of a property of forking we call dual finite character.

	An abstract elementary class can have at most one forking-like notion. This extends the well-known canonicity proof of Harnik and Harrington but the methods are different: we do not rely on the compactness theorem and work with Galois (orbital) types. Along the way, we study relationship between the abstract properties of independence. We give an axiomatic proof that symmetry follows from no order property. This is used in subsequent papers to build a good frame (a local forking-like notion in AECs).

	<p>
	  Any tame abstract elementary class categorical in a cardinal of sufficiently high cofinality admits a good frame: a forking-like notion for 1-types. This gives a construction of a good frame in ZFC from superstability and tameness, a locality property of types that (arguably) is likely to hold in practice. It follows for example that tameness and categoricity at a suitable cardinal imply stability everywhere. Subsequent works rely on this method and improve it further (for example the cofinality requirement is removed in "Independence in abstract elementary classes").

	  Will Boney <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6006">has shown</a> that assuming tameness for types of length two, a good λ-frame (a notion of forking for types of length one over models of size λ) transfers to a good frames for types of length one over models of size above λ. Tameness for types of length two, rather than length one, is used in Boney's proof of the symmetry property. 

	  In this paper, we replace tameness for types of length two by tameness for types of length one. The proof of symmetry is more conceptual and goes through studying independent sequences. We obtain as an interesting corollary of our methods that a well-behaved notion of dimension exists in this framework: any two maximal infinite independent sets have the same cardinality.

	  We introduce the Galois Morleyization of an AEC: a trick to think of semantic (Galois) types as being syntactic. This give a correspondence between AECs and the syntactic framework of stability theory inside a model. We use this to prove the equivalence between no order property and stability in tame AECs as well as a stability spectrum theorem in that context. We also improve results of Boney and Grossberg on the existence of a forking-like notion in stable, fully tame and short AECs. This gives evidence that some stability theory can be developped also in strictly stable AECs.

	  We study general methods to build forking-like notions in the framework of tame AECs with amalgamation. We study here both local notions like good frames and global notions (for types of all lengths). We build a good frame from categoricity in a high-enough cardinal (no matter what its cofinality is), and give conditions under which the frame extends to a global independence notion. Modulo an unproven claim of Shelah, we deduce that Shelah's categoricity conjecture follows from the weak generalized continuum hypothesis and unboundedly many strongly compact cardinals.

	  We work in the framework of tame AECs with amalgamation satisfying a natural notion of superstability (a version of local character of nonsplitting). We show that above a certain Hanf number, unions of chains of λ-saturated models are λ-saturated, and limit models of size λ are unique. We deduce the final piece in the construction of a good frame from tameness and superstability and conclude that for a high-enough λ, a tame superstable AEC has a good frame with underlying class its λ-saturated models.

	<p>
	  Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture for abstract elementary classes says that an AEC categorical in a high-enough cardinal is categorical on a tail of cardinals. It is widely recognized as the main test question in the field of classification theory for AECs. We prove an approximation assuming that the AEC is a universal class (roughly, the class of models of a universal sentence in infinitary logic): categoricity in cardinals of arbitrarily high cofinality implies categoricity on a tail. Moreover, assuming amalgamation, categoricity in a single cardinal above the second Hanf number <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> implies categoricity everywhere above <em>H<sub>2</sub></em>. This is all in ZFC without assuming that the categoricity cardinal is a successor. The method generalizes to AECs that satisfy a locality condition on types (full tameness and shortness) and have primes over models of the form <em>Ma</em>, where <em>M</em> is a model in the class and <em>a</em> is a singleton. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The proof goes by observing that in such classes, the existence of a good frame in a single cardinal implies amalgamation everywhere above the cardinal (this uses the upward frame transfer of Boney). Using the orthogonality calculus developped in Chapter III of Shelah's book on AECs as well as the existence of prime assumption, one can use the upward transfer once again on a suitable frame to prove that if the class is not categorical on a tail, it must have a non-saturated model in every cardinal. To obtain an initial good frame, we use deep results from Shelah's AEC book (Chapter IV).

	<p>

	<p>
	  Working in the framework of tame AECs with amalgamation, we show that many definitions of superstability are equivalent. This includes the Shelah-Villaveces definition in terms of locality of splitting, the uniqueness of limit models, the existence of a good frame, as well as solvability, a definition that Shelah hails as the true counterpart to first-order superstability in chapter IV of his book.

	  We improve several results of Shelah's milestone paper <a href="http://shelah.logic.at/files/394.pdf">#394</a> on categorical AECs with amalgamation, getting uniqueness of limit models from categoricity in a suitable limit cardinal. As a corollary, we deduce the existence of a good frame (a local notion of forking) in this framework and also show that the model in the categoricity cardinal has some saturation if the cardinal is big-enough (but potentially has low cofinality) . This furthers our understanding of AECs with amalgamation that are not necessarily tame. With tameness, we also improve work of Will Boney and the second author (from "Chains of saturated models in AECs") on getting uniqueness of limit models from superstability and tameness. For example, if a class is λ-superstable and λ-tame, then limit models of size λ are unique and right above λ, unions of chains of saturated models are saturated. These results are proven using the symmetry property for splitting, isolated by the first author. The main technicals tools are a downward transfer of symmetry and a way to obtain it from failure of the order property.

	We prove the converse of a theorem in "Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture in universal classes". The later paper showed that fully tame and short AECs with amalgamation and existence of primes over sets of the form <em>Ma</em> that are categorical in a high-enough cardinal and are categorical on a tail of cardinals. We show that a fully tame and short AEC with amalgamation categorical on a tail of cardinal has primes on a tail of cardinals. More generally, we show that, for any AEC with a superstable-like global independence notion its class of saturated models has primes. This generalizes an argument of Shelah who proved it for saturated models of successor size.

	We introduce μ-Abstract Elementary Classes (μ-AECs) as a broad framework for model theory that includes complete boolean algebras and Dirichlet series, and begin to develop their classification theory.  Moreover, we note that μ-AECs correspond precisely to accessible categories in which all morphisms are monomorphisms, and begin the process of reconciling these divergent perspectives: not least, the preliminary classification-theoretic results for μ-AECs transfer directly to accessible categories with monomorphisms.

      <p>
	We prove a downward transfer from categoricity in a successor in tame AECs: If an AEC <em>K</em> is <em>LS(K)</em>-tame, has amalgamation, and no maximal models, and is categorical in a successor cardinal above <em>H<sub>1</sub></em>, then it is categorical in all cardinals above <em>H<sub>1</sub></em>. This complements the upward transfer of Grossberg and VanDieren and improves the Hanf number of <em>H<sub>2</sub></em> in Shelah's downward transfer (provided the class is tame). The argument uses orthogonality calculus and gives alternate proofs to both the Shelah and the Grossberg-VanDieren transfers. We deduce Shelah's categoricity conjecture (so the Hanf number is <em>H<sub>1</sub></em>) for universal classes with amalgamation. Heavily using results of Shelah and the weak generalized continuum hypothesis, we can also prove Shelah's categoricity conjecture for tame AECs with amalgamation.

	We survey recent developments in the study of tame abstract elementary classes. We emphasize the role of abstract independence relations such as Shelah's good frames.

      <p>
      We prove Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture in universal classes. The threshold for categoricity is below the second Hanf number. We show for example that a universal <em>L</em><sub>ω<sub>1</sub>, ω</sub> sentence that is categorical in some cardinal above <em>B</em><sub><em>B</em><sub>ω<sub>1</sub></sub></sub></span> (where <em>B</em> denotes the ב function) is categorical in all such cardinals.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do <em>not</em> assume anything else: the categoricity cardinal need not be a successor, the class is not assumed to have amalgamation, and the proof is in ZFC (no large cardinals or weak GCH).
  </p>
      <p>
	The proof heavily uses Shelah's structure theory for universal classes developped in Chapter V of his book on AECs (an earlier version is Shelah's paper #300), as well as the categoricity transfer for tame AECs with amalgamation that have primes over models of the form <em>Ma</em>.

    We prove that in an AEC with amalgamation and no maximal models categorical above the Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number, the model in the categoricity cardinal is Galois-saturated. This answers a question asked independently by Baldwin and Shelah.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the proof, we rely heavily on our work on the symmetry property with VanDieren. We also use results of Shelah on extracting a strictly indiscernible subsequence from any sequence and prove that categoricity implies failure of the order property, even of relatively small lengths.

      The paper initiates a systematic investigation of the abstract elementary classes that have amalgamation, satisfy tameness (a locality property for orbital types), and are stable (in terms of the number of orbital types) in some cardinal. Assuming mild cardinal arithmetic (e.g. SCH or working above a strongly compact), we give a full characterization of the eventual stability spectrum. We connect it to the uniqueness of limit models, the behavior of chains of saturated models, and the saturation spectrum. We conclude that if a class is stable on a tail of cardinals, then it is superstable (in any of the senses proven equivalent in the above paper with Grossberg). Thus there is a clear notion of superstability in the framework of tame AECs with amalgamation.

      Starting from an abstract elementary class with no maximal models, Shelah and Villaveces have shown (assuming instances of diamond) that categoricity implies a superstability-like property for a certain independence relation called nonsplitting. We generalize their result as follows: given an abstract notion of independence for Galois (orbital) types over models, we derive that the notion satisfies a superstability property provided that the class is categorical and satisfies a weakening of amalgamation. This extends the Shelah-Villaveces result (the independence notion there was splitting) as well as a result of the first and second author where the independence notion was coheir. The argument is in ZFC and fills a gap in the Shelah-Villaveces proof.

  We propose the notion of a quasiminimal abstract elementary class (AEC). This is an AEC satisfying four semantic conditions: countable Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number, existence of a prime model, closure under intersections, and uniqueness of nonalgebraic orbital types over every countable model. We exhibit a correspondence between Zilber's quasiminimal pregeometry classes and quasiminimal AECs: any quasiminimal pregeometry class induces a quasiminimal AEC (this was known), and for any quasiminimal AEC there is a natural functorial expansion that induces a quasiminimal pregeometry class. We show in particular that the exchange axiom is redundant in Zilber's definition of a quasiminimal pregeometry class.

      In the setup of abstract elementary classes satisfying a local version of superstability, we prove the uniqueness property for a certain independence notion arising from splitting. This had been a longstanding technical difficulty when constructing forking-like notions in this setup. As an application, we show that the two versions of forking symmetry appearing in the literature (the one defined by Shelah for good frames and the one defined by VanDieren for splitting) are equivalent.

      We show, assuming a mild set-theoretic hypothesis, that if an abstract elementary class (AEC) has a superstable-like forking notion for models of cardinality λ  and a superstable-like forking notion for models of cardinality λ<sup>+</sup>, then orbital types over models of cardinality λ<sup>+</sup> are determined by their restrictions to submodels of cardinality λ. By a superstable-like forking notion, we mean here a good frame, a central concept of Shelah's book on AECs. 
    </p>
    <p>
  It is known that locality of orbital types together with the existence of a superstable-like notion for models of cardinality λ implies the existence of a superstable-like notion for models of cardinality λ<sup>+</sup>, but here we prove the converse. An immediate consequence is that forking in λ<sup>+</sup> can be described in terms of forking in λ.

  The internal size of an object <em>M</em> inside a given category is, roughly, the least infinite cardinal λ such that any morphism from <em>M</em> into the colimit of a λ<sup>+</sup>-directed system factors through one of the components of the system. The existence spectrum of a category is the class of cardinals λ such that the category has an object of internal size λ. We study the existence spectrum in μ-abstract elementary classes (μ-AECs), which are, up to equivalence of categories, the same as accessible categories with all morphisms monomorphisms. We show for example that, assuming instances of the singular cardinal hypothesis which follow from a large cardinal axiom, μ-AECs which admit intersections have objects of all sufficiently large internal sizes. We also investigate the relationship between internal sizes and cardinalities and analyze a series of examples, including one of Shelah---a certain class of sufficiently-closed constructible models of set theory---which show that the categoricity spectrum can behave very differently depending on whether we look at categoricity in cardinalities or in internal sizes.

    <p>
      Forking is a central notion of model theory, generalizing linear independence in vector spaces and algebraic independence in fields. We develop the theory of forking in abstract, category-theoretic terms, for reasons both practical (we require a characterization suitable for work in μ-abstract elementary classes, i.e. accessible categories with all morphisms monomorphisms) and expository (we hope, with this account, to make forking accessible and useful to a broader mathematical audience). In particular, we present an axiomatic definition of what we call a stable independence notion on a category and show that this is in fact a purely category-theoretic axiomatization of the properties of model-theoretic forking in a stable first-order theory.
    <p>
  We then show that any coregular locally presentable category with effective unions admits a forking-like independence notion. This includes the cases of Grothendieck toposes and Grothendieck abelian categories.
    </p>
    <p>
  We also give conditions for existence and canonicity of stable independence notions. Specifically, an accessible category with directed colimits whose morphisms are monomorphisms will have at most one stable independence notion.  Moreover, assuming a large cardinal axiom, a cofinal full subcategory will have a stable independence notion if and only if a certain order property fails. This establishes, in particular, a category-theoretic characterization of stability (in the model-theoretic sense) for accessible categories.

      The third author has shown that Shelah's eventual categoricity conjecture holds in universal classes: class of structures closed under isomorphisms, substructures, and unions of chains. We extend this result to the framework of multiuniversal classes. Roughly speaking, these are classes with a closure operator that is essentially algebraic closure (instead of, in the universal case, being essentially definable closure). Along the way, we prove in particular that Galois (orbital) types in multiuniversal classes are determined by their finite restrictions, generalizing a result of the second author.

      The categoricity spectrum of a class of structures is the collection of cardinals in which the class has a single model up to isomorphism. Assuming that cardinal exponentiation is injective (a weakening of the generalized continuum hypothesis, GCH), we give a complete list of the possible categoricity spectrums of an abstract elementary class with amalgamation and arbitrarily large models. Specifically, the categoricity spectrum is either empty, an end segment starting below the Hanf number, or a closed interval consisting of finite successors of the Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number (there are examples of each type). We also prove (assuming a strengthening of the GCH) that the categoricity spectrum of an abstract elementary class with no maximal models is either bounded or contains an end segment. This answers several longstanding questions around Shelah's categoricity conjecture.

      We study multidimensional diagrams in independent amalgamation in the framework of abstract elementary classes (AECs). We use them to prove the eventual categoricity conjecture for AECs, assuming a large cardinal axiom. More precisely, we show assuming the existence of a proper class of strongly compact cardinals that an AEC which has a single model of <em>some</em> high-enough cardinality will have a single model in <em>any</em> high-enough cardinal. Assuming a weak version of the generalized continuum hypothesis, we also establish the eventual categoricity conjecture for AECs with amalgamation.

        We investigate, in ZFC, the behavior of abstract elementary classes (AECs) categorical in many successive small cardinals. We prove for example that a universal <em>L</em><sub>ω<sub>1</sub>, ω</sub> sentence categorical on an end segment of cardinals below the first uncountable strong limit must be categorical also everywhere above the first uncountable strong limit. This is done without any additional model-theoretic hypotheses (such as amalgamation or arbitrarily large models) and generalizes to the much broader framework of tame AECs with weak amalgamation and coherent sequences.

      An accessible category is, roughly, a category with all sufficiently directed colimits, in which every object can be resolved as a directed system of "small" subobjects. Such categories admit a purely category-theoretic replacement for cardinality: the internal size. Generalizing results and methods from "Internal sizes in μ-abstract elementary classes",  we examine set-theoretic problems related to internal sizes and prove several Löwenheim-Skolem theorems for accessible categories. For example, assuming the singular cardinal hypothesis, we show that a large accessible category has an object in all internal sizes of high-enough cofinality. We also introduce the notion of a <em>filtrable</em> accessible category - one in which any object can be represented as the colimit of a <em>chain</em> of strictly smaller objects - and examine the conditions under which an accessible category is filtrable. We prove (modulo a small technical condition) that accessible categories with directed colimit are filtrable.

  We exhibit a bridge between the theory of <em>cellular categories</em>, used in algebraic topology and homological algebra, and the model-theoretic notion of <em>stable independence</em>. Roughly speaking, we show that the combinatorial cellular categories (those where, in a precise sense, the cellular morphisms are generated by a set) are exactly those that give rise to stable independence notions. We give two applications: on the one hand, we show that the abstract elementary classes of roots of Ext studied by Baldwin-Eklof-Trlifaj are stable and tame. On the other hand, we give a simpler proof (in a special case) that combinatorial categories are closed under 2-limits, a theorem of Makkai and Rosický.

      We give a self-contained introduction to accessible categories and how they shed light on both model- and set-theoretic questions. We survey for example recent developments on the study of presentability ranks, a notion of cardinality localized to a given category, as well as stable independence, a generalization of pushouts and model-theoretic forking that may interest mathematicians at large. We give many examples, including recently discovered connections with homotopy theory and homological algebra. We also discuss concrete versions of accessible categories (such as abstract elementary classes), and how they allow nontrivial "element  by element" constructions. We conclude with a new proof of the equivalence between saturated and homogeneous which does not use the coherence axiom of abstract elementary classes.

      We show that no faithful functor from the category of Hilbert spaces with linear isometries into the category of sets preserves directed colimits. Thus Hilbert spaces cannot form an abstract elementary class, even up to change of language. We deduce an analogous result for the category of commutative unital C*-algebras with *-homomorphisms. This implies, in particular, that this category is not axiomatizable by a first-order theory, a strengthening of a conjecture of Bankston.

      We show that pure monomorphisms are cofibrantly generated (generated from a set of morphisms by pushouts, transfinite composition, and retracts) in any locally finitely presentable additive category. In particular, this is true in any category of R-modules.
