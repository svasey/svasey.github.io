  Urpkg is enforcing a lot of restrictions on the installation script it runs,
  compared to a "classical" installation with root privileges. Since a
  lot of installation programs were not written to deal with an unprivileged
  installation, problems involving <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">permission denied</span>”</span> errors can
  and will occur occasionally. You can usually find the installation command's
  error message in urpkg's installation log file (by default
  in <code class="filename">/var/tmp/install.log</code>). You should always read that
  file after an installation, successful or not.
</p><p>
  Those errors are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> considered bugs in urpkg, as they
  are due to the installation command. However, you should know how to deal with
  them as they occur pretty often when installing large software. In
  the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/downloads/files/more_control_and_pkg_man.txt" target="_top">
  LFS package user hint</a>, the author suggests using special versions of
  commonly used programs, like <span class="command"><strong>install</strong></span>, modified to catch
  possible errors and arrange for the installation scripts to use them. In my
  opinion, this is not general enough, so this has not been implemented in urpkg
  (you could try to do it using the preinstall script though). If you have ideas
  on how to solve the problems described in this section, please share them. See
  <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Contributing to urpkg">Chapter 5, <em>Contributing to urpkg</em></a>.

      Sometimes the installation command needs write access to the current
      directory. This is often due to libtool wanting to relink some libraries
      at installation time. Sometimes also the installation program wants to use
      some log file or <span class="command"><strong>touch</strong></span> some temporary file.
    </p><p>
      Most of the time, the package user does not have write access to the build
      directory. What you usually do is to extract the tarball as a normal user,
      cd to it and begin to build. In that case, the default permission of the
      current, build directory should be something like 0755. Therefore the
      package user does not have write access.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429574"></a>Solution</h4></div></div></div><p>
      You should definitely arrange for the current directory to be world
      writable. A quick and dirty way to do that is
    </p><pre class="screen">
      <code class="prompt">$ </code>chmod o+w .
    </pre><p>
      If that is not enough (sometimes the installation script needs write
      access to other existing files for example), you could just go with
    </p><pre class="screen">
      <code class="prompt">$ </code>chmod -R o+w .
    </pre></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Programs writing to non-install directories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id429612"></a>Programs writing to non-install directories</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Problem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429617"></a>Problem</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The installation program wants to write somewhere it is not allowed to.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429627"></a>Solution</h4></div></div></div><p>
      If you want to allow the program to write there, just
      use <code class="option">--gen</code> to make the location an install directory.
    </p><p>
      If you don't want the program to write there, then you have a bit more
      work to do. Maybe you made a mistake specifying the destination paths at
      configure time (e.g you gave the <code class="filename">/usr/local</code> prefix
      instead of <code class="filename">/usr</code>). Sometimes the program just wants to
      install some locales and in that case you just have to create the
      destination directories, make them installation directories and run the
      install command again. As a last resort, you can consider going into the
      Makefile (or whatever installation script you are using) and changing the
      lines that cause problems. You can then complain to the program's
      maintainer about this unexpected behavior.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Unwanted permission/ownership changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id429665"></a>Unwanted permission/ownership changes</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Problem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429670"></a>Problem</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The installation program wants to change the permission of some
      directories like <code class="filename">/usr</code>
      or <code class="filename">/usr/bin</code>, e.g to 0755 while they are install
      directories. It can also happen that it wants to change their owner and
      group to root.
    </p><p>
      The installation program could also want to change the ownership of some
      of its executable to root, or some other user.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429697"></a>Solution</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The permission / ownership change of install directories is due to poorly
      written installation script. The command that causes this is usually
      something like
    </p><pre class="screen">
      <code class="prompt">$ </code>install -d /usr/bin
    </pre><p>
      If the directory already exists, its permissions will be changed to 0755
      which is typically not wanted in our case. A command like
    </p><pre class="screen">
      <code class="prompt">$ </code>install -d --owner=root --group=root /usr/bin
    </pre><p>
      is even worse since it does not take into account the possibility of
      installation in a user's home directory for example. In both cases, the
      solution is simple: remove those commands from the offending Makefile /
      installation script and complain to the maintainer.
    </p><p>
      If the installation program tries to change the ownership of its own
      executable, this is also unwanted except if the executable are suid or
      sgid. In any case, you cannot allow this change to happen so just remove
      the offending lines from the Makefile and change the ownership and / or
      permissions of the files afterward if you really want to.
    </p><p>
      Regarding suid and sgid programs, you should <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span>
      use the package user as a user or group for a suid or sgid file. The
      reason for this is that package user still have more privileges than
      ordinary user, and should not be used for anything else but installing
      packages.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Overwritten or deleted files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id429756"></a>Overwritten or deleted files</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Problem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429761"></a>Problem</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Some installation program sometimes try to overwrite files from another
      package, or even delete them so that they can be replaced with the new
      versions the installation program provides. Since urpkg does not allow
      them to overwrite files, the installation command fails.
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429773"></a>Solution</h4></div></div></div><p>
      The solution depends on what the installation command intends to do with
      the files. If they are e.g index files,
      like <code class="filename">/usr/share/info</code> then you can consider making
      them shared files using <code class="option">--share</code>. If you don't want your
      old files to be erased, just copy them somewhere and copy them back after
      the installation. If you want your old files to be erased, just remove
      them or move them somewhere else.
    </p><p>
      In the end, make sure to check what packages the files you moved around
      belong to. Don't hesitate to use the <code class="option">--free-files</code>
      and <code class="option">--add-files</code> options to move files to a different
      package.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Ldconfig"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="id429808"></a>Ldconfig</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Problem"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429813"></a>Problem</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Some install script run ldconfig. Since they don't have permission to
      write to <code class="filename">/etc/ld.so.cache</code>, this command fails
    </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="id429829"></a>Solution</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Most script won't fail just because ldconfig fails. In any case, ldconfig
      will be run automatically afterward by a postinstall script.
